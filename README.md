# E-commerce-ORM

This is a back-end ORM that utilizies sequelize to connect an express.js API with a MYSQL database. When the user adds a database name and logs into my SQL, they are able to connect to the database. After entering schema and seed commands, the development database is created and can be seeded with test data. By using Insomnia Core, the user can test their API post, put, and delete routes, as well as update, create, and delete items within their store inventory. The dotenv package ensures that sensitive information, such as passwords, are kept private.

Challenges: Making the videos! All functions work but they could be more streamlined.

Future additions: A front end user friendly database for the store owner to utilize to make changes.
